# ðŸš¨ Firefighter Offline Demo

This small demo shows how to accept payments with stripe with Vue.js using a
serverless function. It's actually not that bad to set up! The shop also shows
how a number of concepts work in Vue. Server side rendering and routing is done
with Nuxt.js. Centralized state management with Vuex for product details. Of
note, using computed properties, `.sync`, CSS Grid, and `transition-group`.

Articles explaining the demo will be available soon.

The serverless function is open source as well, available at this repo
